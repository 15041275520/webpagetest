WPT batch automation API spec

We plan to provide the following Python APIs to the WebPageTest (WPT) users to help them automate their batch testing job processing. No  tice your batch tests will be defined as a set of test ids once they are submitted.

def ImportURLs(url_filename):
  """Load the URLS in the file into memory.

  Args:
    url_filename: the file name of the list of interested URLs

  Returns:
    The list of URLS
  """

def SubmitBatch(url_list, test_params, server_url):
  """Submit the tests to WebPageTest server.

  Args:
    url_list: the list of interested URLs
    test_params: the user-configured test parameters
    server_url: the URL of the WebPageTest server

  Returns:
    A dictionary which maps a WPT test id to its URL if submission
    is successful.
  """

def CheckBatchStatus(test_ids, server_url):
  """Check the status of tests.

  Args:
    test_ids: the list of interested test ids
    server_url: the URL of the WebPageTest server
 
  Returns:
    A dictionary where key is the test id and content is its status.
  """


def GetXMLResult(test_ids, server_url):
  """Obtain the test result in XML format.

  Args:
    test_ids: the list of interested test ids
    server_url: the URL of WebPageTest server

  Returns:
    A dictionary where the key is test id and the value is a DOM object of the
    test result.
